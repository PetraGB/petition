# Petition

A simple web application where one can register an account in order to sign a petition. Users can also login to see who else signed the petition or delete their signature and account. It was deployed on heroku, please feel free to [try it out yourself](http://stoppushbacks.herokuapp.com)!

The signature is made using a canvas element and is saved with account details. It can also be redone after it has been deleted, in case you only noticed a mistake after saving it or changed your mind again.

You can change details on your profile, such as city or website. This will also change how others see your details in the list of those who have signed the petition.
